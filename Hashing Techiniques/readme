  Hashing Techniques
  
  
      1.    Open Hashing      (Closed Addressing)
      
      
                 *    Chaining
                 
                 
      2.    Closed Hasing     (Open Addressing)
      
      
                  *   Linear Probing
                  
                  
                  *   Quadratic Probing
                  
                  
                  *   Double Hashing
